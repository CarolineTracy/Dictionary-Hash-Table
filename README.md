# Dictionary Hash Table
This is an implementation of a dictionary using a hash table in C. This dictionary can then be used to count the number of occurrences of each unique character in a text file. This was created as part of my Computer Science 1 class.

All the code for the implementation of a dictionary using a hash table is in the file dictionary.c.
